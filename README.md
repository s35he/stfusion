# Spatio-temporal data fusion

This respository contains the R code to accompany the paper ``Spatio-temporal data fusion for the analysis of in situ and remote sensing data using the INLA-SPDE approach'' by Shiyu He and Samuel W.K. Wong.

## Simulation study

Run `simulation.R` to replicate the simulated scenarios discussed in Section 4 of the paper.

## Real data analysis

The script `real_data.R` provides demo code for the analysis of the algae bloom data presented in Section 5 of the paper.
